							<h2>Phang Nga Bay</h2>
							<p>Phang Nga Bay is unique. A day out here is an unforgettable experience that will definitely get you thinking. A distinctive feature of the bay is the sheer limestone cliffs that jut vertically out of the emerald-green waters. These islands are home to sheltered fauna that are possible to observe on certain tours. James Bond Island and Koh Panyee are just two of the more famous spots in this bay.</p>

							<h2>Phuket's Old Town</h2>
							<p>Sino-Portuguese splendours and funky shops in the most unlikely places will surprise and delight you in the heart of Phuket's sleepy provincial capital. Phuket town offers much more than you think with some excellent restaurants and local sights. The unique blend of colonial and Chinese architecture along with a tangible quaintness makes for a fascinating and unforgettable afternoon spent sauntering around Phuket's Old Town. Expect the unexpected and don't forget your camera.</p>

							<h2> Bangla Road Nightlife</h2>
							<p>There are few things in this world to prepare you for an after-dark stroll down Patong's Bangla Road. However, a sense of humour and an open mind are prerequisites if you're looking to have some fun. In fact, there's only one undeniable and obvious fact about Bangla – it's nothing like home. With its ladyboys, exotic girls, enchanted westerners (mostly male) and enough extraverts to fill a Disney cast of thousands, shopping or sipping on a beer at Bangla Road at night is a definite 'Dear Diary' moment. </p>

							<h2>Big Buddha</h2>
							<p>Visible from most of the south of Phuket, the Big Buddha is a recent arrival to the island. The image stands on the top of the Nakkerd Hills and looks down over Chalong, Kata and Rawai. It cost 30 million baht to construct and is 45 metres high. Next to it stands a smaller, golden image that is actually made of brass and there is a shrine near the site's car park. The drive up to the Big Buddha takes you through the 'real' Thailand and the view from the top is enhanced if you take a map to identify the many, many sights.</p>

							<h2>Wat Chalong</h2>
							<p>Wat Chalong is one of Phuket's most important temples and visited by thousands each year. It's beautifully decorated with infinite reflections from hundreds of tiny glass pieces and several pagodas. On special holidays Wat Chalong hosts 'country fairs' with a real local flavour where you can buy just about anything and snack on Thai food to your heart's content. Wat Chalong has an interesting history and is Phuket Island's spiritual centre. You haven't seen Phuket if you've never visited this fascinating temple. </p>

							<h2> Phi Phi Island</h2>
							<p>Phi Phi Island is Thailand's island-superstar. It's been in the movies. It's the topic of conversation for travelers all over Thailand. For some, it's the only reason to touchdown in Phuket. Even with all the hype, it doesn't disappoint. Phi Phi's beauty is a large chunk of the allure. The islands, when approached by boat, rise from the sea like a fortress. Sheer cliffs tower overhead, then give way to beach-fronted jungle. It's love at first sight.</p>

							<h2>Phuket FantaSea Show</h2>
							<p>It's wacky but fun and very professionally done. Trapeze artists, elephants on stage and pyrotechnics combine in a Las Vegas-style show. You'll see nothing else like it anywhere on the planet. Combining Thai traditional myths with humour, fantasy and a loose plotline that keeps getting more and more amusing, FantaSea's extravaganza is a highly entertaining and riveting show that deserves to be top of our Top Ten Must See and Do in Phuket list. </p>

							<h2>Phuket Viewpoints</h2>
							<p>There are many viewpoints looking out over east and west Phuket affording sunrise as well as sunset views. Ok, so everyone goes to Promthep but it doesn't make it any less spectacular. There, you'll get fabulous views over the ocean stretching as far as Phi Phi Island on a good day. Check out Phuket's other viewpoints such as the 'Three Beaches' hilltop venue on the road between Nai Harn and Kata or sip a cocktail at the After Beach Bar (also on the same road) while the golden ball slips into the western horizon. </p>

							<h2>Similan Islands </h2>
							<p>Just 84 km northwest of the deckchairs and the bustling crowds of Phuket's Patong Beach lies a gateway to another world. Koh Similan is one of the best-known island groups in the Andaman Sea, largely because of the wonders that wait beneath the clear blue waters that surround it. Generally counted among the 10 most interesting dive areas in the world, this little archipelago has also become a favourite destination for yachts and tour boats. "Similan" is derived from the Malay sembilan, and means "nine". </p>

							<h2>Wat Khao Rang</h2>
							<p>Wat Khao Rang (or Sumnak Song Khao Rang) enjoys a great location in Phuket Town, on the slope of the popular Rang Hill. It has a large golden sitting Buddha – the first of its kind on the island and the spiritual centre of the island for many locals. This temple is busy at weekends when locals pay a visit. It not only looks amazing, it was also the first big Buddha image Phuket ever had until the giant Buddha was built in the Nakkerd Hills between Chalong and Kata. Wat Khao Rang grounds are divided in two areas: the original building supporting the sitting Buddha on its roof, with its back against the green hillside, and the new temple next to it.</p>

							<h2>Jui Tui Shrine</h2>
							<p>Jui Tui Shrine is a popular Chinese temple that plays a pivotal part in the annual Phuket Vegetarian Festival. Located on Soi Phuthorn, Ranong Road, not far from Phuket’s main market, it’s a must-see site for all newcomers to Phuket as one of the oldest and the most respected spiritual centres around. Jui Tui Temple was previously located in Soi Romanee in Phuket Old Town and was moved to its current location after a fire many years ago. The grounds are quite impressive and display photos of the temple dating back to 1911 when it was just a single, stand-alone construction without side buildings or walls.</p>

							<h2>Wat Phra Thong</h2>
							<p>Wat Phra Thong is not very large but it’s a pleasant place to visit. The main attraction is the half-buried golden Buddha image which is said to be untouchable as every person who has tried to dig it out is reported to have been cursed. Legend has it that a boy who tied his buffalo to an object that looked like a post fell ill and died, along with the buffalo. His father went to check the post and it turned out to be part of a buried Buddha image. One of the island’s oldest temples, it received a visit in 1909 by King Rama VI, who gave it its official name.</p>

							<h2> Kiew Tien Keng Shrine</h2>
							<p>This stunning shrine located in a superb location at Saphan Hin Park in Phuket Town, Kiew Tien Keng must be one of the most beautiful places of worship in Phuket. It’s the only shrine that is located near the seashore and is considered the departure spot to send all gods/deities back to heaven on the final night of the Vegetarian Festival. It’s where the colourful parades of each shrine officially come to an end when a normal diet can resume.</p>

							<h2>Kathu Shrine</h2>
							<p>Kathu Shrine has shared a long history with Phuket’s Vegetarian Festival and is known as the original home of the festival. Rumor has it that a Chinese opera from mainland China came to town and without any particular reasons, members of this group started to fall ill. After a while they realised that they had forgotten to carry on with their important traditional vegetarian diet. Finally, they held a vegetarian diet ceremony at their temporary opera house at Kathu and within no time all the sickness and problems amazingly disappeared. Locals couldn’t believe their eyes when witnessing what had happened. They too participated in the ceremony and have been carrying it on until today. This is the roots of the great annual Vegetarian Festival that Phuket is known for.</p>
