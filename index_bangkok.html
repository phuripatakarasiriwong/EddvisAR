							<h2>The Grand Palace or Wat Prakaew</h2>

							<h2>Wat Arun (The Temple of Dawn)</h2>
							<p>The impressive silhouette of Wat Arun’s towering spires is one of the most recognised in Southeast Asia. Constructed during the first half of the 19th century in the ancient Khmer style, the stupa showcasing ornate floral pattern decked out in glazed porcelain is stunning up close. Apart from its beauty, Wat Arun symbolises the birth of the Rattanakosin Period and the founding of the new capital after Ayutthaya fell.</p>

							<h2>Floating markets</h2>
							<p>The pioneer of all floating markets, Damnoen Saduak continues to offer an authentic experience despite its increasingly touristy atmosphere. Imagine dozens of wooden row boats floating by, each laden to the brim with farm-fresh fruits, vegetables or flowers. Food vendors fill their vessels with cauldrons and charcoal grills, ready to whip up a bowl of ‘boat noodle’ or seafood skewers upon request.</p>

							<h2>Chinatown</h2>

							<h2>Chao Phraya River & Waterways</h2>
							<p>One of the most scenic areas, the riverside reflects a constantly changing scene day and night: water-taxis and heavily laden rice barges chugging upstream, set against a backdrop of glittering temples and luxury hotels. The areas from Wat Arun to Phra Sumeru Fortress are home to some of the oldest settlements in Bangkok, particularly Bangkok Noi and its charming ambience of stilt houses flanking the complex waterways.</p>

							<h2>Khao San Road</h2>
							<p>If Bangkok is a city where East greets West, then Khao San Road is the scene of their collision, the place where they jostle for superiority and poke one another in the eye. With travellers from every corner of the modern world, sleek clubs playing sophisticated sounds, eclectic market stalls, converted VW cocktail bars, and foods tamed to suit the Western palate, it may seem clear who won the fight.</p>

							<h2>Jim Thompson’s House</h2>

							<h2>Wat Saket</h2>
							<p>Wat Saket is the temple where you can visit the unmistakable golden Chedi of 'Phu Khao Thong'or the Golden mountain. Built on top of a high hill in the old city of Bangkok, this massive construction has a long and troubled history. Built first by King Rama III (1787–1851), the first attempt failed and the chedi collapsed because of the soft nature of the ground and the construction was abandoned. </p>
